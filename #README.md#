##Description:

This library is a collection of some implementations about machine learning and natural language processing during the process I study related fields.


##Contents:

### machine learning

classfy algorithms
- fisher classifier (linear discriminative analysis)
- naive bayes classfier 

cluster algorithms
- kmeans

graphical models
-conditional random field(under construction)
-hidden markov model

nonlinear models
-support vector machine
-neural network

reduction algorithms
- principal component analysis

regression algorithms
- linear regression
- logistic regression

statistics
- mcmc

Build bigram posting list for a specific dictionary(wordlist)
#  For each query, construct the conjunction of posting list using its bigram
#  Delete the possible word in the conjuction list if its jaccard coefficient is small
#  Calculate the edit distance to find the most likely word
